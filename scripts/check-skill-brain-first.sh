# CI guard for the v0.36.x skill_brain_first doctor check.
#
# Runs `gbrain doctor --json` against this repo's own skills/ and parses
# the JSON to assert `checks[name=skill_brain_first].status !== "warn"`.
# Doctor's exit code only flags `fail`, not `warn`, so explicit JSON-
# parsing is required to gate `bun run verify` on this warning-class check
# (F15 from /plan-eng-review).
#
# When this fires, the brain-first compliance check found new offenders
# in this repo's skills. Either:
#   - add `brain_first: exempt` to the flagged skill's frontmatter (if it
#     legitimately doesn't need brain-first), or
#   - add a canonical `> **Convention:** see [conventions/brain-first.md]`
#     callout near the top of the skill body.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-skill-brain-first.sh
# Exit:  0 on ok; 1 on warn or unexpected.

# Run doctor with this repo's own skills as the explicit target.

# --fast is REQUIRED here. Without it, doctor calls connectEngine() which
# exits 1 when no ~/.gbrain/config.json exists (the CI runner's case — no
# brain init), producing zero stdout and tripping the parser's
# `parse_error` fallback. --fast routes through runDoctor(null, ...) which
# runs filesystem-only checks (resolver_health, skill_conformance,
# skill_brain_first) and emits the standard JSON envelope. The
# skill_brain_first check is filesystem-only by design, so --fast is the
# correct knob, not a workaround.
